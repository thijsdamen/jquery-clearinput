[jQuery clear input](http://github.com/thijsdamen/jquery-clearinput/)
==================================================

About this plugin
--------------------------------------

This plugin was created to clearn input fields when focused. It is custom these days to use a placeholder value in an input field. And for every single you you needed 3 or 4 lines of code.
No more, mostly to suit my own needs and hopefully someone else's this plugin was created.
